# DragSelectionGridView
Recreation of Google Images app's gridview drag selection


DragSelectionGridView is a grid view with support to drag-to-select gestures. It is also accompanied by a fly-out context menu that provides a better UX than using contextual action bar since it's bottom-aligned near users fingers once they finish dragging.
